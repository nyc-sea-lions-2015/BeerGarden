## DB ##

-  Good DB constraints
-  Good use of AR column methods (t.references)

## VIEWS ##

- Using layout well
- Duplicate info being presented on index page
- Move AR methods out of views - refactor to controller - then to model

## Model ##
- Have model responsible for doing AR heavy lifting - order(:category, :name)
